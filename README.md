# SIOC 209: Python for Data Analysis

This course focuses on analyzing data of all types using the Python programming language. No programming experience is necessary.

We start with an introduction (or refresher) to the command line. We then cover the fundamentals of Python and its data types, followed by the data analysis packages Numpy and Pandas, and plotting packages Matplotlib and Seaborn, plus statistics and interactive visualization.

Jupyter (IPython) notebooks are used throughout. Conda is used for package management and virtual environments. All notebooks are in Python 3 unless otherwise noted.

## Course Philosophy

1. Just like anything else, you learn Python by doing. With a few exceptions, you're not going to break your computer by trying new commands. So just try it and see what happens. Print output of commands. Print values of variables. Kick the thing until it works.
2. When you don't know how to do something, google it. You'll be amazed by the solutions you'll find to do _thing x_ if you google "python thing x".
3. Learn keyboard shortcuts, as many as you can. Tab-complete in the shell and IPython/Jupyter!
4. Remember Zed's sage wisdom:
	* Practice every day.
	* Don't over-do it. Slow and steady wins the race.
	* It's alright to be totally lost at first.
	* When you get stuck, get more information.
	* Try to solve it yourself first.

## Assignments

### Weekly assignments

Weekly take-home assignments will follow the course schedule, reinforcing skills with exercises to analyze and visualize scientific data. Assignments will given out on Thursdays and will be due the following Thursday, using TritonEd.

### Final Project

You will choose a data set of your own or provided in one of the texts and write a Python program (or set of Python programs or mixture of .ipynb and .py/.sh scripts) to carry out a revealing data analysis. Have a look at Shaw Ex43-52 and McKinney Ch10-12 for more ideas.

Requirements:

* Submit your project as either: a Jupyter notebook (or collection of notebooks), a Python script (or collection of scripts), or a combination of the two.
* Use at least three (3) application-specific packages, such as:
	- Data analysis and plotting: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
	- Statistics and modeling: `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`
	- Bioinformatics: `scikit-bio`, `biopython`
	- Climate science: `cdms`, `iris`
* Use at least three (3) user-defined functions.
* Optional: Create user-defined modules and classes for use in your code.

Note: There are no midterm or final exams.

## Schedule Overview

_Schedule is subject to change._

There are 10 weeks and 2 lessons per week, for a total of 20 lessons. Math!

Week 1 plus half of Week 2 will be an introduction to the command line. By the end of this tutorial, everyone will be familiar with basic Unix commands. 

Weeks 2-4 will be an introduction to programming using Python. The main text will be Shaw's _Learn Python 3 the Hard Way_. For those with experience in a programming language other than Python, Lutz's _Learning Python_ will provide a more thorough introduction to programming Python. We will learn to use IPython and IPython Notebooks (also called Jupyter), a much richer Python experience than the Unix command line or Python interpreter. 

Weeks 5-10 will focus on Python packages for data analysis. We will work through McKinney's _Python for Data Analysis_, which is all about analyzing data, doing statistics, and making pretty plots. You may find that Python can emulate much of the functionality of R and MATLAB.

* In addition to doing the readings, please follow along writing code (this is integral to the Shaw readings), and do any Study Drills (Shaw) and Chapter Quizzes (Lutz).

Glossary
-----

**object** -- Pretty much everything in Python is an object: numbers, strings, data structures, functions, classes, modules. Every object exists in its own "box" called a _Python object_.

**type** -- Each object has an associated type (e.g. string or function) and internal data. Entering `type(X)` will give the type of `X`.

**variable** -- Name for object within a particular namespace. The type information and internal data (value) of the object is stored in the object itself.

**attributes** -- Other Python objects stored inside an object. For example, if you have an object stored as variable `x`, then the anything after the dot in `x._____` is an attribute.

**methods** -- A common type of attribute, methods are functions attached to an object with access to the object's internal data. They always contain parentheses afterward, with or without arguments. For example, if you set `x = 'abc'` then `x.upper()` will return `'ABC'`.

**function** 

**module** -- A module is any Python file without the `.py` extension.

**class** -- A new type of Python object that you create.

**package** -- A package is a directory of modules including an additional `__init__.py` file ("library" is a generic term sometimes used interchangeably with "package").

**booleans** -- TRUE, FALSE

**control structures** -- if, then, else, while, with, break, pass, try
